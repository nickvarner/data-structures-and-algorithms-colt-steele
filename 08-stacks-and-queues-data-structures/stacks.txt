1) what is a stack?

A LIFO data structure
        LIFO ?? Last In, First out

The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack

How is it used?
- Think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or ..anything. As you pile it up the last thing is what gets removed first.

How we'll visuailze a stack

    ITS A SERIES OF NODES!

        Last        SIZE = 4            First
        10 <------ 2 <------ 22 <-------- 7

We've seen this before! The Call stack!! Recursion!! Ring a bell???

BIG O OF STACKS
Insertion - O(1)
Removal - O(1)
Searching - O(N)
Access - O(N)

!!** R E C A P **!!

- Stacks are a LIFO data structure where the last value in is always the first one out.
- Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!
- They are not a built in data structure in JavaScript but are relatively simple to implement
