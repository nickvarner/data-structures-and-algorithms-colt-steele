What it sounds like basically. You have a linear data structure like an array

[5, 8, 1, 100, 12, 3, 12]

If we're looking for 8, were going to check each index of the array and looks for 8

create a function to search linearly. I'm going to give you pseudo code, and you create the function

- The function accepts an array and a value
- Loop through the array and check if the current array element is equal to the value
- If it is found return the index at which the element is found
- If it's not found, return -1

This strongly resembles or mimics the functionality of the built in method indexOf

function linearSearch(arr, val) {
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if(arr[i] === val) {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}
