Dijkstra's Algorithm is one of the most used algorithms of all time.

So what is it?

It finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.

Mr. Dijkstra was a dutch programmer, physicist, essayist and all around smarty-pants.
He helped to advance the field of computer science from an 'art' to an academic discipline.

Whys it useful?
GPS - fastest route
Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans

  and many more uses!!

The Approach

1) Every time we look to visit a new node, we pick the node with the smallest known distance to visit first.

2) Once we've moved to the node we're going to visit, we look at each of its neighbors.

3) For each neighboring node, we calculate the distance by summing the total edges that lead to the node were checking from the starting node.

4) If the total distance to a node is less than the previous total, we store the new shorter distance for that node.
