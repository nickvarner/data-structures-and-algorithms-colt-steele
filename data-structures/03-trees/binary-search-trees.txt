!!** BINARY SEARCH TREES **!!

What is a tree?
- A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship.

Tree Terminology
Root - Top node in tree
Child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
Parent - The converse notion of a child 
Siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent

Edge - the connection between one node and another

Tree Uses
- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Tree
- Artificial Intelligence
- Folder in Operating Systems
- Computer File Systems

Most Common Tree is a -- Binary Search Tree

Rules for Binary Search TREES
- every parent node has at most, two children
- every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent (so its sorted, and we use numbers)
- every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent

Big O of BST

Insertion - O(log n)
Searching - O(log n)
