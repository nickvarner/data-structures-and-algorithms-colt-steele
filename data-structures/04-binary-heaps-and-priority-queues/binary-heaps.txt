Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!

In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller 
than their child nodes.

**!! MAXBINARYHEAP **!!
- Each parent has at most two child nodes
- The value of each parent node is ALWAYS greater than its child nodes
- In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between siblings
- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

Binary Heaps are used to implement a priority queues, which are very cmoonly used data structures.

They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms.

The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) 
and restoring the properties is called down-heap (also known as bubble-down, sift-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max)

BIG O OF BINARY HEAPS

Great at insertion and deletion

Insertion - O(log n)
Deletion - O(log n)

Recap
- Binary heaps are very useful data structures for sorting and implemeting other data structures like priority queues.
- Binaryheaps are either MaxBinaryHeaps or MinBinaryHeaps with parents either being smaller or larger than their children.
